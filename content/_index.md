I'm a commercial and creative writer, proofreader and editor based in Suffolk, UK.

Friendly and reliable, I offer a range of professional, affordable services to make your life that little bit easier.

Self-publishing author?  I can provide you with a free sample edit on the first 1000 words of your manuscript, followed by a fixed quote, which includes a final read-through of the manuscript.

I can also proofread your CV, thesis, dissertation, job application... the list goes on!

If you're a business owner, I can provide you with compelling, engaging web content and attention-grabbing blog posts that will keep your customers returning.

Planning a wedding? Ask me about my personalised wedding poetry! A bespoke wedding poem makes for a highly original ceremony reading and a beautiful memento from the day.
