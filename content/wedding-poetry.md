Let me make your wedding day even more special with a [bespoke poem](https://www.facebook.com/pg/meganwhitingfreelance/photos/?tab=album&album_id=822838874547759) personalised to yourself and your partner.

Once I've asked you a few questions relating to the style and content of the poem you've been imagining (for example, a romantic, rhyming poem with 4 verses or a light-hearted, non-rhyming piece) I can create something which fully reflects your sentiments and will only ever be heard at your wedding!

Alternatively, a personalised wedding poem would make a wonderful gift for a much-loved family member or friend!

Poems are beautifully printed on parchment-style paper to be treasured forever.

Have a look at my article below on Bride Magazine to find out more!

# Testimonials

> "We asked Megan to write a poem that could be read out at our wedding and we honestly couldn’t be happier with the result! Not only did she manage to capture everything we wanted in one beautiful poem, she kept it personal to us as a couple. We felt incredibly lucky to have a one of a kind poem for our special day. Megan was super quick to get back to us, too!”

-- M. Tyler, client

> "Megan wrote a beautiful, personalised poem for me to use as a reading at my brother’s wedding ceremony. Megan was great to work with - a fast turnaround and the poem was perfect! Would highly recommend!"
