title: "Let's Talk Wedding Poetry!"
---

With wedding season fast approaching, I thought it might be helpful to talk about my personalised poetry in a little more detail.

More often than not, I’m contacted by brides looking for a bespoke poem to take the place of a reading at their wedding ceremony, but I’ve also written poems for key members of the wedding party to give the newlyweds as a unique gift! Printed on parchment-style paper, the poems look lovely when framed.

Before work begins, I ask the following questions:

* When, where and how did the couple meet?
* When and where are they getting married?
* Can you tell me a little about their personalities and hobbies?
* Do they have any interesting habits or quirks?
* How many verses would you like the poem to have?
* What style of poem are you looking for e.g. rhyming, non-rhyming...?
* What sort of tone would you prefer e.g. funny, sentimental...?
* Would you like the poem to be written from your perspective?
* Is there anything else you would like to include e.g. references to in-jokes, pets, something particularly special about the relationship...?

Once we’ve chatted through the above (either via email or over the phone), discussed cost (postage is free of charge!) and I've drawn up a basic contract, it’s all systems go!

I always email poems to my clients before they go to print and are posted, in case they would like any last-minute changes to be made.

Please [get in touch](/contact) if you've been considering a personalised poem for a wedding (or any other special event)!
