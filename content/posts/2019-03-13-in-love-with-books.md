# Book Benefits

I’ve found comfort and enjoyment in books for as long as I can remember, and, fortunately for me, as a writer, proofreader and editor, I get to read on a daily basis! Luckily, reading as part of my job hasn’t quelled my appetite for books and I still read an awful lot; for pleasure, escapism and as a way of de-stressing!

Even now, I come across words I feel compelled to look up; either because they’re unfamiliar, or I’m not sure how to pronounce them, as I’ve only ever seen them written down. . . ! Ultimately, I’m always discovering new things about the world through the books I read. They allow me to carry on learning, and I absolutely love that.

I feel that the amount of reading I do is constantly improving my writing, editing and proofreading skills. I’ve become familiar with a range of genres and writing styles, and a well-written book motivates me to record my own thoughts and ideas. (That being said, I also benefit from badly-written books, as they teach me how not to write!)

I don’t need an excuse to pick up a book, but it’s been said that reading can help to improve memory, analytical skills, focus and concentration. . . bonus!

# What do I read?

I tend to opt for fiction over nonfiction, but read anything that piques my interest. As such, I can’t say I have a ‘favourite’ author. The shelves in my office hold a strange mix of books, ranging from classics by Austen and the Brontë sisters, to fictional thrillers, poetry anthologies and (my guilty pleasure, as they're just so comforting) Maeve Binchy novels!

David Nicholls has me laughing out loud, Matt Haig makes me feel a little better about the world, and, over two decades since my first venture into a library (it blew my mind that I could take books home for free!) I still love discovering new authors.

I hosted a blog a few years ago and dedicated a page to books I’d particularly enjoyed, giving each a short review. I won’t go into detail here, but if you’re looking to get your hands on something unique, I can point you in the direction of _The Gargoyle_ by Andrew Davidson, or, if you like a good plot twist, you might enjoy Karen Joy Fowler’s _We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves_.

# What about you?

If you’d like me to recommend you an author or book, based on your preferences, or if you’d like to recommend something to me, I’d be delighted to hear from you!

We should all do more of the things we love.
