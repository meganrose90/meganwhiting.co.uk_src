I can help you attract customers to your business and keep them coming back with vibrant copy tailored to the needs of your readership; either through creating new content, or refreshing yours.

With my background in creative writing, I can really spice up your web content and help you sell your product or service!  My friendly, informal blog posts will add a sense of personality to your website, whilst offering advice to the reader. Have a look at my guest posts on [new unemployment](https://www.modernlifeblogs.com/2017/03/one-newly-unemployed/), [starting a freelance career](https://www.thesitsgirls.com/writing-tips/freelance-writing/) and [coping with anxiety](https://anxiouslass.com/be-proud-of-yourself/).

Self-publishing author? I can create exciting blurbs for your novels that will capture the interest of the reader and showcase your writing.

To make sure you are completely satisfied with the end result, I will offer you regular updates as the project progresses.

# Testimonials

> "I originally hired Megan to proofread my first novel, but then asked her to draft some potential blurbs. I really liked the way Megan incorporated quotes from my book to reflect key themes and felt that the blurbs really captured the essence of the novel."

-- W. Bishop, author

> "Megan helped me to add personality to some stuffy intro text that I had about my design business. I had previously read some of Megan's creative writing portfolio and was impressed. I liked how she spent time with me and listened to exactly what I needed. I found the experience very smooth. She was both super quick to create draft options and was always in close contact throughout the project. I would highly recommend Megan to people who need meaningful written content for their website."

-- R. Simpson, Squircle Creative

> "Having a growing blog is great but it can be hard work, especially when you're trying to find good guest writers who genuinely fit with your blog's personality and brand. I get lots of unsuitable guest post applications and it becomes pretty disheartening at times. When Megan sent me her article, I was actually excited and I could tell her work would really appeal to my readers. Her article is funny, candid and motivational, everything that my blog is about and my readers love. Megan's writing is a breath of fresh air and I would highly recommend."

> Working with Megan has been a pleasure. She has helped me by editing my picture book, middle-grade novel and personal statement. As someone who is also horrible at grammar, I have learnt a lot. Megan is also great at communicating and very patient, which is important when working with an editor. My work is in much better shape now and I look forward to working with Megan again in the near future!
