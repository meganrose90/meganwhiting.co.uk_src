I have loved reading and writing for as long as I can remember, so was delighted to achieve a degree in English Literature and Creative Writing with the Open University in 2015!

I later developed an interest in proofreading/editing and joined the [Society for Editors and Proofreaders](https://www.sfep.org.uk/). To date, I have worked on a range of manuscripts, including fantasy novels, self-development books, memoirs, young adult fiction, animated film scripts; even a political parody! I love working with self-publishing authors; providing them with honest feedback and professional editorial suggestions at an affordable cost.

I'm registered as both a proofreader and editor with several self-publishing companies and pride myself on my ability to work to tight deadlines.

A poet at heart, I've had [poems published](https://www.facebook.com/pg/meganwhitingfreelance/photos/?tab=album&album_id=822838874547759) in anthologies and online and take great pleasure in creating bespoke wedding poems!

I have written numerous [blog posts](https://silverstarfish.blog/) about [mental health](https://silverstarfish.blog/tips-for-an-anxious-mind/) and [diet and exercise](https://silverstarfish.blog/foooood/), amongst other topics, and reviewed wonderful books I've read. I have also written blog posts for [Grace & Green](https://graceandgreen.co/) and guest-posted on a number of well-established websites.

I am a member of a local Writers' Workshop and like to lose myself in a novel (or several!) whenever I get a free moment.
