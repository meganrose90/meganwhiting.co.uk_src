Whether you are a self-publishing author seeking an editor for your manuscript or a student looking for a proofreader for a CV, thesis or dissertation, I can provide you with a professional service at an affordable cost.

Before work begins, I offer a free sample proofread or edit, followed by a fixed quote, so that my clients know exactly what to budget for. All quotes include a final read-through of the document once suggestions have been reviewed by the client, leaving no stone unturned!

A member of the SfEP  and with a degree in Creative Writing, I currently provide several self-publishing companies with a range of editoral services, and can be trusted to work diligently on any project; even to tight deadlines.

Let me proofread your document for simple errors, including spelling, punctuation, grammar and consistency, to give you peace of mind. Alternatively, I can carry out an extensive copyedit, offering constructive feedback and thoughtful editorial suggestions in order to improve readability and increase your confidence.

Please send me a message for a free sample proofread or edit, or to discuss my services in greater depth!

# Testimonials

> "I cannot thank Megan enough for the great work she has done on my first novel. Megan maintained polite, laidback yet professional communication throughout the service. Her edit was thorough, even at the end of a 70k word count. Megan was careful not to remove my personal ‘voice’ throughout the novel while ensuring that the content was fit for readers. Not only did she correct grammar and stamp out typos, she went far beyond my expectations by questioning potential plot issues throughout. For those not too precious about their work, Megan is ruthless enough to make sure the story flows and engages without being filled with unnecessary parts that do not add to the plot progression. She kindly commented on these issues via Track Changes, rather than slashing content without comment. Megan prices extremely well for the quality of work she provides and I will be using her for my following novels."

-- P. Hampton, author

> "I was more than pleased with Megan on the editing of my book. Not only was she amazing with her pricing, but she made sure I was happy with everything before she finished! She is very honest and open-minded with her editing. I will be using her for my other books as well!"

-- T. Miller, author

> "I was really pleased with Megan's work. Commas are my nemesis, so I appreciated her help with those! Megan also enabled me to think about some of my problem phrases in a different way, which meant that I was able to rewrite the parts that had been bugging me."

-- L. Andrews, author

> "It was a pleasure working with Megan. All projects were delivered professionally, to deadline, and I look forward to working with Megan again in the future."

-- P. Nykanen, writer and editor

> "Having worked with many editors over the five books I've published, it's difficult to find the right one for a good price. Most I have worked with charged ridiculous amounts for shoddy work, with many misspellings, bad grammar and dodgy sentence structure left in the finished edit. Megan not only charges a good price but really throws herself into finding every problem in a piece of writing, going so far as to look over the document twice to double check everything is legible and satisfying to read. It is refreshing to find an editor that doesn't make you regret your decision to blow away a ton of money just to get a book published. Megan Whiting is one of those editors."

-- T Howard, author

> "Professional service with an easy approach. As this was my first book, I had no idea what I was doing, but Megan made it simple, with a great level of communication throughout. Would definitely recommend to both first-time and long-serving authors."

-- W. Bishop, author

> "Very thorough and much appreciated."

-- M. Petty, author
